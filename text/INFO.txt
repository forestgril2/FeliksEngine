This template was created for personal use. You may tweak it as you like.
Normally it should be located under
~/.local/share/kdevappwizard/templates/cpp_Bjarne_CMake.

std_lib_facilities.h is a header file written by Bjarne Stroustrup and used in his books.
It contains some of the most common headers and functions used and implements some others,
usefull for the examples on these books. Feel free to examine or modify the
header.

3/7/2016: I updated it, in order to be able to work with regex.

29/12/2016: platform.h is removed.

3/1/2017 :Removed some depreceated definitions from std_lib_facilities.h in order to work with Microsoft's compiler.

20/2/2017: Updated the inner CMakeList.txt in order to build shared libs if the user needs to.
Just uncomment what is needed and append the names that correspond to your libraries source files.

Use add_library() in order to *create* one from your code.
Use target_link_libraries( feliksengine somelib) in order to link your code to an external library.
example (let's say you need BOOST) : target_link_libraries( feliksengine ${Boost_LIBRARIES} )
---

"headers" directory should contain any additional header you may write for consistency.
"src" directory should contain any .cc or .cpp file you may write for consistency.
*You have to edit* CMakeList.txt and add these files with their respective
directory.

Example how your project shoulde be structured:
HEADERS:
#{PROJECTFOLDER}/headers/std_lib_facilities.h
#{PROJECTFOLDER}/headers/platform.h

SRC:
#{PROJECTFOLDER}/src/feliksengine.cpp
but
#{PROJECTFOLDER}/example.cpp ->*NOT recommended* <-

 Now, given that any src file is under src dir, a header
 should be included in this way: #Include "../headers/new_header.h",
 while if the src is under the top project directory it should
 be included like: #Include "headers/new_header.h".
